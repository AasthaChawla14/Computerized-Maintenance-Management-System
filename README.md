# Computerized-Maintenance-Management-System

Abstract
The existing framework in the market makes it very cumbersome and difficult to record and maintain the data and information manually and also it consumes a lot of time during the retrieval. If software is used for this purpose, it leads to efficient planning of such maintenance aspects. Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS) or Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) is an essential operational and management tool which leads to effective planning, controlling and scheduling of all the maintenance activities along with the reduction in downtime, decrease in frequency of failures, better management of work orders, improvement in inventory control, reduction in paper work, improvement in the machine life, reduction in the cost life cycles and increased risk management. In this context, the present paper deals with development of CMMS for a plant. Managing the assets involves design considerations, quality of new inventory and effectiveness in service, inspection and maintenance. This practice eliminates manual data entry and allows the maintenance groups to save their time with calibrations and record maintenance by keeping an online check on all the plant activities.
